					<h2>Our story</h2>
					<p className = 'discription'>AV Style was born from a 
													desire to provide beautiful 
													and affordable alternatives 
													to traditional finishes like
													 drywall, stucco, and popcorn 
													 ceilings. Established in 2004 
													 in Ukraine, the owners subsequently
													  moved to Canada and continued to offer
													   their exceptional services here since 2016. 
													   They brought with them a strong work ethic 
													   and a high degree of professionalism as well
													    as a commitment to customer service. They
													     continue to lead the company to greater
													      heights.</p>
					<p className = 'discription'>The key to our success is our strong, creative, and highly 
						skilled team of craftsmen experienced in all aspects of stretch ceilings and wall coverings — 
						from design and consultation to installation and repair.</p>
					<p className = 'discription'>From day one we’ve taken a collaborative approach that honors the vision of our clients and 
						partners. We are proud to have our work on display in homes and commercial spaces throughout North 
						America, Europe, and the Middle East.</p>
